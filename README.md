# langchainr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

As of starting this repo the author has no experience building with
langchain, so the immediate goal is to learn how to build with it, what
better way than by building it into R?

The eventual goal of langchainr will be to provide R users with a
framework for building with Large Language Models. The package will
begin as a wrapper around the python and javascript variants, but it
will aim to stay true to R syntax and styling where possible.

This package is going to be built in public, and may struggle to keep up
with the fast-moving nature of the langchain ecosystem. Bugs, errors and
sub-optimal coding is *very likely*, at least to begin with.

## So what is Langchain and why would I want to use it?

For now, have a look at the repo and the website, more to come.
