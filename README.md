# langchainr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of langchainr is to provide R users with a framework for
building with Large Language Models. The package will begin as a wrapper
around the python and javascript variants, but it will aim to stay true
to R syntax and styling where possible.

This package is going to be built in public, and may struggle to keep up
with the fast-moving nature of the langchain ecosystem. Bugs, errors and
sub-optimal coding is *very likely*, at least to begin with.
